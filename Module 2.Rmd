# Use of force and ethnicity

$k$: county

$i$: Type of force (Compliance Hold, Hands Fists, Pepper Spray, Baton, Leg Strikes, Deadly Force, Take down)


We need to take into account that we don't have information of ethnicity as a categorical variable. Only the proportion of each ethnicity 
$$
\text{Prob(Using Froce}_{ik}) = \beta_{1}\text{Ethnicity}[j] + 
\beta_{2}\text{(Crime Rate AdjPop)}_{k} + 
\beta_{3}\text{Prob(Threat[t])}_{k} + 
\beta_{4}\text{Ethnicity}[j]*\text{Prob(Threat}[t]) +
\beta_{5}\text{(Per Ethnicity[j])}
$$
